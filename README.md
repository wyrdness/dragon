## Overview

Dragons are legendary creatures appearing in the mythology of nearly every ancient culture. Western dragons are typically depicted as winged, four-legged beasts that breathe fire, hoard treasure, and represent evil or chaos. Eastern dragons are long, serpentine creatures without wings that fly magically, associated with water, wisdom, and benevolence.

The universal appearance of dragon myths likely stems from multiple sources: dinosaur fossil discoveries, exaggerated accounts of crocodiles and large snakes, whale bones, and archetypal symbolism representing primal forces of nature.

## Theories & Explanations

### Historical Basis Theories

1. **Dinosaur Fossils**
   Ancient peoples discovering dinosaur fossils created dragon myths to explain them. Protoceratops skulls in Scythian gold-mining regions may have inspired griffin/dragon legends.
   - **Proponent**: Adrienne Mayor (folklorist)
   - **Evidence**: Fossil sites coincide with dragon legend hotspots

2. **Crocodile/Snake Exaggeration**
   Large crocodiles and pythons exaggerated into dragon legends through fear and retelling.
   - **Evidence**: Physical similarity, fear response to large reptiles

3. **Whale Bones**
   Beached whale skeletons interpreted as dragon remains, especially in landlocked areas.
   - **Evidence**: Whale bones found inland, size similarity

4. **Archetypal Symbol**
   Dragons represent primal chaos, nature's power, and psychological forces across cultures.
   - **Proponents**: Carl Jung, Joseph Campbell
   - **Evidence**: Universal independent appearance, consistent symbolism

5. **Collective Predator Fear**
   Dragons combine features of multiple predators: snake body, eagle wings, lion claws.
   - **Evidence**: Dragon incorporates humanity's major predator fears
